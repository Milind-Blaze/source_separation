# Source separation    
   
## Objective:    
This repository contains implementations of various source separation algorithms in Python. Presently, all algorithms are based on non-negative matrix factorization and its variants. More implementations using other techniques will follow.    
     

## Usage:    

All code is written in Python (and functional in version 3.6.8) and uses the libraries listed in __requirements.txt__ 

__requirements.txt__: Requirements file with all libraries (and corresponding versions) to run the code in this repository

            
## Directories:        
     
__Monoaural_source_separation_using_Non-negative_matrix_factorization__: Code for source separation based on the technique described in the paper [Monaural Sound Source Separation by NonnegativeMatrix Factorization With Temporal Continuityand Sparseness Criteria](http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/music/tuomasv/virtanen_taslp2007.pdf).      
__sourcesep__: Code for all implemented source separation algorithms     
__tools__: Code for helper functions
